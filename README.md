Solar-System
============

A solar system completely created in HTML5/CSS3.

============

This project is a little experiment on the capabilities and possibilities of CSS3.
Everything is explained and I personally airy code so that you understand a little operation.
Normally you will have no trouble understanding the code structure AND the operation of this "small" animation.
I welcome your feedback, comments and other suggestions.
